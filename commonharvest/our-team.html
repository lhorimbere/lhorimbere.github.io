                        <p>Alex is a Senior at the University of Maryland majoring in Supply Chain Management and Government and Politics, and minoring in Global Poverty. Alex has experience working with Engineers Without Borders, and the Solar Electric Light fund, doing everything from community income generation in Benin to agricultural productivity in Burkina Faso. During this time, Alex became familiar with the obstacles small producers face, but was also inspired by their great potential to be a catalyst for development in their own communities, as well as through their entire nation. Since then, he has traveled through The Gambia, Senegal, and Nigeria with Landry, researching obstacles, networking with local stakeholders, and laying the groundwork for what has become Common Harvest. While in the Gambia he built networks with local organization such as the National Agricultural Research Institution (NARI), and international organization such as the Peace Corps. </p>

                        <p>Landry is a Senior at the University of Maryland majoring majoring in Civil and Environmental Engineering with a minor in International Engineering, at the University of Maryland. Landry gained early experience with international development projects as a member of Engineers Without Borders’ Burkina Faso team. As the primary translator for the monitoring travel team he learned firsthand what technical and interpersonal skills are necessary to be successful in partnering with agrarian communities in the West African. Later, Landry helped Alex implement the groundwork for Common Harvest in the Gambia. As a civil engineer, a native African from Burundi, and with his extra curricular experience, Landry has many of the technical skills and interpersonal experience to help lead Common Harvest effectively.</p>

                        <p>Pierre Souchet is Senior at the University of Maryland, double majoring in Agriculture & Resource Economics and French with a minor in Agribusiness. As an AgDiscovery mentor, a program sponsored by USDA/APHIS in conjunction with the University of Maryland, Pierre was able to not only satisfy his curiosity for Agriculture Economics but also acquired an aspiration to learn more about Agriculture Economics. Pierre is happy to bring the skills that he learned both as a Student Ambassador and a Research assistant at the University of Maryland to this project in order to contribute to Common Harvest’s goals and its efforts.</p>
